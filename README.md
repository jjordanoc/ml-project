# Speech Fluency Features for Robust Automatic Classification of L2 English Speech using a Small Dataset


This work presents an automatic fluency level classifier of L2 English speech. Using
models such as Support Vector Machines, and a Multilayer Perceptron, comparing
features of three previous works [3], [20], [12] such as speech rate, filled-pauses,
phonation ratio, effective speech rate, and the well know Mel Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC). Furthermore, we utilize the Avalinguo dataset, which [12]
proposed. It comprises 1424 audio samples of individuals speaking, categorized
into three fluency levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Additionally, we
introduce two experiments that demonstrate the robustness of some of these features
and models. Our findings indicate that SVM with Yu & Van Heuven [20] features
provides the highest accuracy and demonstrates the most robustness among all
tested models and features.
